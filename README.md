In this project, I investigated the pricing of European call options with a focus on AAPL stock, using two popular option pricing models: the Black-Scholes (B&S) model and the Heston model. The aim was to compare the pricing accuracy and hedging effectiveness of both models, particularly in the context of Delta-neutral hedging.

To calibrate the Heston model, I used the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and tested different initial parameter guesses. The performance of each model was assessed by evaluating metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), both for option prices and implied volatilities. Results showed that with better initial values, the Heston model clearly outperformed the B&S model, due to its ability to account for stochastic volatility.

I further analyzed the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega) for both models across various strike prices and maturities. The Heston model generally showed higher sensitivity to changes in the underlying asset price, particularly in Delta and Vega values. These findings helped to interpret the risk profiles and responsiveness of options priced under each model.

In the final part of the project, I conducted a Delta hedging analysis on an AAPL call option (strike price $140, maturity on February 17, 2023). I recalculated Delta values daily from December 5 to 21, 2022, using both pricing models. I then constructed and backtested Delta-neutral portfolios based on each model, evaluating their hedging performance through absolute hedging error, portfolio variance, and RÂ² values from regression analysis. The results showed that while both models effectively reduced portfolio risk, the Heston model demonstrated superior performance in terms of lower hedging error and variance.

Overall, this project combines option pricing theory, numerical optimization, and practical hedging analysis, highlighting the advantages of using more advanced stochastic models in financial risk management.
